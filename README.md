# CarRentalService
An automobile rental website

### How to run the website

First, spin up a server to host the static files. I use the following, but you can use anything that serves files.

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`

*Note:* Make sure you are in the project directory when you run this command.

Now open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Voila!
